2 Building Abstractions with Data
=================================

2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction
------------------------------------

Central to data are objects, along with important functions:

Constructor::
  function creating an object
Accessor::
  function accessing attributes of an object

In LISP the building blocks of objects are pairs:

`(cons a b)`::
  constructs a pair, holding the data `a` and `b` within it
`(car x)`::
  accesses the first element of a pair (`a`)

`(cdr x)` :: accesses the second element of a pair (`b`)

Pairs are drawn with box-and-pointer diagrams.

Separate *use* from *representation* of data objects is the essence of
data abstraction. A major benefit of this is twofold: the capacity to
reason about conceptual entities, as well as changing representation. An
example change of representation is controlling the main points of
computation, to be performed at the constructor, or delayed and
performed by the accessor functions. The use will dictate the
representation in this case.

  (define (cons a b)
(lambda (pick)
  (cond ((= pick 1) a)
    ((= pick 2) b))))

  (define (car x) (x 1))

  (define (cdr x) (x 2))
